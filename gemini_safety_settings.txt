The Gemini API provides safety settings that you can adjust during the prototyping stage to determine if your application requires more or less restrictive safety configuration. You can adjust these settings across four filter categories to restrict or allow certain types of content.

This guide covers how the Gemini API handles safety settings and filtering and how you can change the safety settings for your application.

Note: Applications that use less restrictive safety settings may be subject to review. See the Terms of Service for more information.
Safety filters
The Gemini API's adjustable safety filters cover the following categories:

Category	Description
Harassment	Negative or harmful comments targeting identity and/or protected attributes.
Hate speech	Content that is rude, disrespectful, or profane.
Sexually explicit	Contains references to sexual acts or other lewd content.
Dangerous	Promotes, facilitates, or encourages harmful acts.
These categories are defined in HarmCategory. The Gemini models only support HARM_CATEGORY_HARASSMENT, HARM_CATEGORY_HATE_SPEECH, HARM_CATEGORY_SEXUALLY_EXPLICIT, and HARM_CATEGORY_DANGEROUS_CONTENT. All other categories are used only by PaLM 2 (Legacy) models.
You can use these filters to adjust what's appropriate for your use case. For example, if you're building video game dialogue, you may deem it acceptable to allow more content that's rated as Dangerous due to the nature of the game.

In addition to the adjustable safety filters, the Gemini API has built-in protections against core harms, such as content that endangers child safety. These types of harm are always blocked and cannot be adjusted.

Content safety filtering level
The Gemini API categorizes the probability level of content being unsafe as HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW, or NEGLIGIBLE.

The Gemini API blocks content based on the probability of content being unsafe and not the severity. This is important to consider because some content can have low probability of being unsafe even though the severity of harm could still be high. For example, comparing the sentences:

The robot punched me.
The robot slashed me up.
The first sentence might result in a higher probability of being unsafe, but you might consider the second sentence to be a higher severity in terms of violence. Given this, it is important that you carefully test and consider what the appropriate level of blocking is needed to support your key use cases while minimizing harm to end users.

Safety filtering per request
You can adjust the safety settings for each request you make to the API. When you make a request, the content is analyzed and assigned a safety rating. The safety rating includes the category and the probability of the harm classification. For example, if the content was blocked due to the harassment category having a high probability, the safety rating returned would have category equal to HARASSMENT and harm probability set to HIGH.

By default, safety settings block content (including prompts) with medium or higher probability of being unsafe across any filter. This baseline safety is designed to work for most use cases, so you should only adjust your safety settings if it's consistently required for your application.

The following table describes the block settings you can adjust for each category. For example, if you set the block setting to Block few for the Hate speech category, everything that has a high probability of being hate speech content is blocked. But anything with a lower probability is allowed.

Threshold (Google AI Studio)	Threshold (API)	Description
Block none	BLOCK_NONE	Always show regardless of probability of unsafe content
Block few	BLOCK_ONLY_HIGH	Block when high probability of unsafe content
Block some	BLOCK_MEDIUM_AND_ABOVE	Block when medium or high probability of unsafe content
Block most	BLOCK_LOW_AND_ABOVE	Block when low, medium or high probability of unsafe content
N/A	HARM_BLOCK_THRESHOLD_UNSPECIFIED	Threshold is unspecified, block using default threshold
If not set, the default block setting is Block some for all categories.

You can set these settings for each request you make to the generative service. See the HarmBlockThreshold API reference for details.

Safety feedback
generateContent returns a GenerateContentResponse which includes safety feedback.

Prompt feedback is included in promptFeedback. If promptFeedback.blockReason is set, then the content of the prompt was blocked.

Response candidate feedback is included in Candidate.finishReason and Candidate.safetyRatings. If response content was blocked and the finishReason was SAFETY, you can inspect safetyRatings for more details. The content that was blocked is not returned.

Adjust safety settings
This section covers how to adjust the safety settings in both Google AI Studio and in your code.

Google AI Studio
You can adjust safety settings in Google AI Studio, but you cannot turn them off.

Click Edit safety settings in the Run settings panel to open the Run safety settings modal. In the modal, you can use the sliders to adjust the content filtering level per safety category:



Note: If you set any of the category filters to Block none, Google AI Studio will display a reminder about the Gemini API's Terms of Service with respect to safety settings.
When you send a request (for example, by asking the model a question), a warning No Content message appears if the request's content is blocked. To see more details, hold the pointer over the No Content text and click warning Safety.

Gemini API SDKs
The following code snippet shows how to set safety settings in your GenerateContent call. This sets the harassment (HARM_CATEGORY_HARASSMENT) and hate speech (HARM_CATEGORY_HATE_SPEECH) categories to BLOCK_LOW_AND_ABOVE which blocks any content that has a low or higher probability of being harassment or hate speech.

Python
Go
Node.js
Web
Dart (Flutter)
Kotlin
Java
from google.generativeai.types import HarmCategory, HarmBlockThreshold

model = genai.GenerativeModel(model_name='gemini-1.5-flash')
response = model.generate_content(
    ['Do these look store-bought or homemade?', img],
    safety_settings={
        HarmCategory.HARM_CATEGORY_HATE_SPEECH: HarmBlockThreshold.BLOCK_LOW_AND_ABOVE,
        HarmCategory.HARM_CATEGORY_HARASSMENT: HarmBlockThreshold.BLOCK_LOW_AND_ABOVE,
    }
)
