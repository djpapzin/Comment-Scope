- [x] Add comparative analysis feature to compare comments across multiple videos or an entire channel
- [ ] Generate comprehensive video summaries based on video content and comments
- [ ] "Scraping comments..." must change to "Scrutinizing comments..."
- [ ] Fix the following error: "DuplicateWidgetID: There are multiple widgets with the same key='scrape_trending_comments_button_unique'.

To fix this, please make sure that the key argument is unique for each widget you create."
